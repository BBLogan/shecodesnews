Bex Logan - She Codes News Project

## About this project
Give a brief description - what is it for - how do you use it?

## How to run the code
Give a quick step-by-step guide on how to download and run your codebase. 
You can assume the reader is another developer so don't feel like you need to explain what a virtual enviornment is etc.

Give directions like "clone the repo to your local machine", "create a virtual environment", "migrate the database" etc.

When you need to specify terminal commands surround them with backticks (on the ~ button, to the left of 1 button) like `python manage.py runserver`. This formats them as code in the markdown document

## Database schema
My ERD ./relative_path_to_your_entity_relationship_diagram
